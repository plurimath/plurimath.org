  Plurimath now supports the newest core feature of MathML 4: semantic math with
  intent encoding. This post explains the concept of semantic math, the intent
  feature of MathML 4, its support in the UnicodeMath language, and how
  Plurimath ties all this together.

== The art of math representation

**MathML**, **OMML**, **LaTeX math**, **AsciiMath**, and **UnicodeMath** are
commonly used math representation languages used to encode math in digital form.
Each of these systems has its own syntax and conventions for representing
mathematical expressions.

Consider the representation of math itself to be two separate but related
problems:

* **Visual representation**: How math looks when rendered on a screen or paper.
* **Semantic representation**: What math means, and how it can be interpreted by
software. i.e. how math can be understood and processed by machines.

The common usage today is focused on the former -- presenting mathematical
expressions visually.


== Semantic math

=== Purpose

Semantic math is the method of encoding mathematical expressions to reflect
their meaning and structure, not just how they look.

This means that instead of just seeing symbols and numbers, software can
understand what those symbols and numbers represent. In effect, it allows
software to interpret and process mathematical expressions and content.

There are several reasons why semantic math is important:

* Disambiguation: Understanding the meaning behind an expression avoids
ambiguity and misinterpretation of math content.

* Accessibility: Screen readers and other assistive technologies can read
math out loud with the correct meaning to visually impaired users.

* Interoperability: Software can exchange and process math content with
preserved meaning.


=== Represented meaning behind symbols

The greek symbol "eta" (`Œ∑`) is commonly used to represent in physics:

* efficiency, which is a dimensionless value
* dynamic viscosity, which has a unit of Pa¬∑s or N¬∑s/m¬≤

Given a mathematical expression like "Œ∑ = 0.85":

[source,xml]
----
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>Œ∑</mi>
  <mo>=</mo>
  <mn>0.85</mn>
</math>
----

It is unclear whether it represents:

* "Œ∑ = 0.85": efficiency is 0.85
* "Œ∑ = 0.85": dynamic viscosity is 0.85

Semantic math can encode the specific meaning behind the symbol.


=== Differentiated operators and variables

Given this MathML encoding of "ŒîH":

[source,xml]
----
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>Œî</mi>
  <mi>H</mi>
</math>
----

It is unclear whether it represents:

* "ŒîH": a change in enthalpy (in thermodynamics)
* "Œî ¬∑ H": area of a triangle with base Œî and height H

Presentation MathML is unable to differentiate between these two meanings, but
semantic math can encode the specific meaning behind the symbol.


== MathML 4 and semantic math

=== Introduction

MathML is the W3C standard for representing mathematical content on the web.
https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/[MathML 3], published in 2014, provides two forms
of math representation, namely **Presentation MathML** and **Content MathML**.

https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/chapter4.html[Content MathML] is MathML's answer to
semantic encoding. In particular, "Strict Content MathML" is designed to
be an implementation of OpenMath (hence compatible).

https://openmath.org[OpenMath] is a standard developed by the
https://openmath.org/about/[OpenMath Society] for representing formal
mathematical objects and semantics through the use of extensible Content
Dictionaries.

Content MathML is meant to be used in "Parallel Markup" with Presentation MathML,
which is to say that Content MathML is to be used alongside Presentation MathML
to provide both visual and semantic representation of math.

Unfortunately, the complexity and verbosity of Content MathML and OpenMath have
limited their adoption -- it is already difficult enough to encode expressions
for visual presentation, requiring an additional content encoding increases
the burden significantly.

Due to a similar history, other math representation languages have also been
solely focused on visual representation, with little emphasis on semantic
understanding.


=== MathML 4 and `intent`

MathML 4 revamps this situation with the new focus on semantic math by
introducing the `intent` attribute to **Presentation MathML**, a way to bridge
with **Content MathML** to clarify the meaning of different parts of a math
expression.

Think of it as adding a descriptive note to a math symbol to indicate what it
represents. This is particularly useful for tools that need to interpret math,
such as screen readers for visually impaired users or search engines.

By using the `intent` attribute in **MathML 4**, you can provide explanatory
notes for symbols that represent specific mathematical functions. This ensures
that anyone (or any software) reading the **MathML** can understand the exact
purpose of each symbol.

For example:

.Using intent in MathML 4 to represent the absolute value of "x"
[example]
====
[source,xml]
----
<mrow intent="absolute-value($x)">
  <mo>|</mo>
  <mi arg="x">x</mi>
  <mo>|</mo>
</mrow>
----
====

In this example, the `intent` attribute is used to specify that the expression
represents the absolute value of "x". Without it, it would be difficult for the
reader (or the software) to understand the specific meaning of the expression,
potentially leading to misinterpretation or loss of context.

TIP: For detailed information about the `intent` attribute, visit the
link:https://w3c.github.io/mathml-docs/intent-explainer/#intent[MathML 4 intent-explainer page].


=== Intent operators

MathML 4 introduces a standardized set of intent operators that can be used to
encode semantic math expressions. These operators are used to indicate the
intent of the expression, providing additional context and meaning to the math
symbols.

The full list of intent operators can be found at the
link:https://w3c.github.io/mathml-docs/intent-explainer/#intent-operators[MathML 4 intent-explainer page].


== UnicodeMath and semantic math

=== Introduction

**UnicodeMath** is a plain text representation of mathematical notation that
leverages Unicode characters to encode mathematical symbols and structures.
Plurimath has supported UnicodeMath in all releases since April 2024.

The creator of UnicodeMath,
https://www.linkedin.com/in/murraysargent[Murray Sargent III], is a member of
the MathML Working Group and has been involved in the development of MathML 4.
He has extended UnicodeMath to work with MathML 4, in particular support for the
`intent` attribute.

MathML, being an XML format, is today primarily used as a canonical representation of
a math expression, instead of an input format. Economical math representation
languages, such as UnicodeMath and AsciiMath, are used as input formats for math
expressions for translation into MathML.

The latest version of UnicodeMath supports the `intent` attribute, allowing
UnicodeMath to encode semantic math expressions in MathML 4.


=== Encoding intent

The latest version of UnicodeMath introduces a new "intent" operator
`‚ìò` (U+24D8) for indicating intent.

Let's take the example of encoding the absolute value of "x" in UnicodeMath.
The MathML intent operator for the math operation of "absolute value" is
`absolute-value(...)`.

To encode this in UnicodeMath, the `‚ìò` operator is used to denote the
intent of an expression with the following syntax.

.UnicodeMath syntax for encoding intent
[source,plain]
----
‚ìò("{mathml-intent-operator-and-function}" {math-expression})
----

The intent expression is composed of two elements:

* the intent string;
* the expression to which the intent is applied.


The following example demonstrates how the absolute value of "x" is encoded in
UnicodeMath using the `‚ìò` operator.

.Using intent in **UnicodeMath** to represent the absolute value of `x`
[example]
====
[source,plain]
----
‚ìò("absolute-value(x)" |ùë•|)
----
====

NOTE: Encoding of `intent` is not supported in **UnicodeMath**. The `‚ìò` is used
in **UnicodeMath** for the input and output of the `intent`(as a syntax of
**UnicodeMath**).


== Encoding intent in Plurimath

=== Explicit encoding

There are two ways to explicitly express intent in Plurimath.

. **via MathML**: Plurimath supports the `intent` attribute when MathML is used
as the input for a Formula object.

. **via UnicodeMath**: Plurimath supports the `intent` operator `‚ìò` when
UnicodeMath is used as the input for a Formula object.



.Encoding explicit intent in Plurimath using MathML
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
xml <~HERE
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
  <mstyle displaystyle="true">
    <mrow intent="absolute-value(x)">
      <mo>|</mo>
      <mi>x</mi>
      <mo>|</mo>
    </mrow>
  </mstyle>
</math>
HERE
formula = Plurimath::Math.parse(xml, :mathml)
formula.to_asciimath(intent: true)
# => "‚ìò("absolute-value(x)" |ùë•|)"
----
====


.Encoding explicit intent in Plurimath using UnicodeMath
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
formula = Plurimath::Math.parse('"‚ìò("absolute-value(x)" |ùë•|)"', :mathml)
formula.to_mathml(intent: true)
# =>
# <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
#   <mstyle displaystyle="true">
#     <mrow intent="absolute-value(x)">
#       <mo>|</mo>
#       <mi>x</mi>
#       <mo>|</mo>
#     </mrow>
#   </mstyle>
# </math>
----
====



=== Implicit encoding (automatic intent)

Other than explicitly specifying intent, Plurimath supports semantic notions of
math operators, and **can automatically provide implicit `intent`** when
converting to MathML. Hence the easiest way of encoding `intent` is to simply
trust Plurimath to do it.

Using the math operation of obtaining the absolute value of "x" as an example:

* Plurimath understands the AsciiMath encoding of the function `abs(...)` as the
absolute value operation.

* Plurimath will automatically encode the intent of the operation when
converting to MathML.

By default, `intent` encoding is not enabled in MathML output. You will need to
specify the `intent: true` option when converting to **MathML**.

For example:

.Using implicit intent in Plurimath to represent the absolute value of "x"
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
math = Plurimath::Math.parse("abs(x)", :asciimath)
puts math.to_mathml(intent: true)
> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
>   <mstyle displaystyle="true">
>     <mrow intent="absolute-value(x)">
>       <mo>|</mo>
>       <mi>x</mi>
>       <mo>|</mo>
>     </mrow>
>   </mstyle>
> </math>
----
====

If value of `abs` exceeds one word, an `arg` attribute will be used to reference
the value of `abs`.

For example:

.Using intent in Plurimath to represent the absolute value of an equation
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
math = Plurimath::Math.parse("abs(xy)", :asciimath)
puts math.to_mathml(intent: true)
> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
>   <mstyle displaystyle="true">
>     <mrow intent="absolute-value($a)">
>       <mo>|</mo>
>       <mrow arg="a">
>         <mi>x</mi>
>         <mi>y</mi>
>       </mrow>
>       <mo>|</mo>
>     </mrow>
>   </mstyle>
> </math>
----
====

NOTE: The `intent` option for `to_...` methods is not supported by any language
other than **MathML**.


== Operations that support intent encoding

The full list of **Plurimath** classes that support `intent` encoding can be
found at:

* link:https://github.com/plurimath/plurimath/blob/main/intent_supported_classes.adoc[Intent supported classes]


== Support for intent in other math languages

Currently, **MathML** and **UnicodeMath** are the only math languages that
support intent encoding. **OMML**, **AsciiMath** and **LaTeX math** do not have
any syntax available for intent encoding.

The Plurimath team is constantly evaluating the need for intent encoding in
other math languages and will consider adding support for intent encoding in
other math languages in the future.


== Conclusion

Semantic math is the future of digital math representation. With the advent
of MathML 4 and the introduction of the `intent` attribute, it is now possible
to encode the meaning and structure of mathematical expressions in a way that
can be understood by software.

Plurimath is one of the first math libraries that provide full support for
`intent`, including in the understanding of intent in both MathML and
UnicodeMath.

By leveraging the power of semantic math, Plurimath makes math more accessible
and understandable for everyone.
