  Semantic math and intent encoding in MathML 4.
---

== What is Semantic Math?

Semantic math is the method of encoding mathematical expressions to reflect their meaning and structure, not just how they look. This means that instead of just seeing symbols and numbers, software can understand what those symbols and numbers represent. This deeper understanding allows software to better interpret and work with mathematical content, making it more useful for tasks in education, research, and digital publishing.

For example, consider the mathematical expression `"x^2 + y^2 = z^2"`. In traditional math notation, this expression is simply a visual representation. However, in semantic math, this expression would be encoded to capture the meaning that it represents the Pythagorean theorem, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are the sides of a right triangle.

Another example is the summation symbol `∑`. In visual notation, it is just a symbol, but in semantic math, it can be encoded to indicate that it represents the operation of summation over a specified range, providing additional context such as the function being summed and the limits of summation.

== How Does "Intent" Work in MathML 4?

**MathML 4** introduces the `intent` attribute, which helps clarify the meaning of different parts of a math expression. Think of it as adding a descriptive note to a math symbol to indicate what it represents. This is particularly useful for tools that need to interpret math, such as screen readers for visually impaired users or search engines.

By using the `intent` attribute in **MathML 4**, you can provide explanatory notes for symbols that represent specific mathematical functions. This ensures that anyone (or any software) reading the **MathML** can understand the exact purpose of each symbol.

For example:

.Using intent in MathML 4 to represent the absolute value of x
[example]
====
[source,xml]
----
<mrow intent="absolute-value($x)">
  <mo>|</mo>
  <mi arg="x">x</mi>
  <mo>|</mo>
</mrow>
----
====

In the example above, the `intent` attribute is used to specify that the expression represents the absolute value of x. Without it, it would be difficult for the reader (or the software) to understand the specific meaning of the expression, potentially leading to misinterpretation or loss of context.

== How Can We Encode Intent Using UnicodeMath?

**UnicodeMath** is a plain text representation of mathematical notation that leverages Unicode characters to encode mathematical symbols and structures. To encode intent using **UnicodeMath**, a special character `ⓘ` (U+24D8) is used.

For example:

.Using intent in **UnicodeMath** to represent the absolute value of x
[example]
====
[source,plain]
----
ⓘ("absolute-value(x)" |𝑥|)
----
====

In the example above, the `ⓘ` character is used to denote the intent of the expression. The intent expression is composed of two elements:

* the intent string
* the expression to which the intent is applied

NOTE: Encoding of `intent` is not supported in **UnicodeMath**. The `ⓘ` is used in **UnicodeMath** for the input and output of the `intent`(as a syntax of **UnicodeMath**).

== Can We Encode Intent Using Other Math Languages, e.g., AsciiMath?

No, not all math languages support intent encoding. For example, **AsciiMath** and **LaTeX** does not have any syntax available for intent encoding unlike **UnicodeMath**(as explained in the previous section).

== How to Encode Intent in Plurimath?

Input syntax of `intent` is supported for **MathML** and **UnicodeMath** in **Plurimath**.
In **Plurimath**, `intent` encoding is available only for specific **Plurimath** classes when converting to **MathML**.
`Intent` encoding is not supported by default, you need to specify the `intent` option when converting to **MathML**.

For example:

.Using intent in Plurimath to represent the absolute value of x
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
math = Plurimath::Math.parse("abs(x)", :asciimath)
puts math.to_mathml(intent: true)
> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
>   <mstyle displaystyle="true">
>     <mrow intent="absolute-value(x)">
>       <mo>|</mo>
>       <mi>x</mi>
>       <mo>|</mo>
>     </mrow>
>   </mstyle>
> </math>
----
====

If value of `abs` exceeds one word, an `arg` attribute will be used to reference the value of `abs`.

For example:

.Using intent in Plurimath to represent the absolute value of an equation
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
math = Plurimath::Math.parse("abs(xy)", :asciimath)
puts math.to_mathml(intent: true)
> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
>   <mstyle displaystyle="true">
>     <mrow intent="absolute-value($a)">
>       <mo>|</mo>
>       <mrow arg="a">
>         <mi>x</mi>
>         <mi>y</mi>
>       </mrow>
>       <mo>|</mo>
>     </mrow>
>   </mstyle>
> </math>

NOTE: The `intent` encoding is not supported in any language other than **MathML**.
