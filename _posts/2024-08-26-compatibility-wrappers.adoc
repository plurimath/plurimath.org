  **Plurimath** now offers more control and customization over how symbols are used across different languages, using compatibility wrappers.
---

== Introduction

In our continuous effort to improve **Plurimath**'s versatility and usability, we are excited to announce a significant update that enhances how symbols are handled across different mathematical representation languages. This update introduces compatibility wrappers that provide more control and customization options for users.

== What are Compatibility Wrappers?

Compatibility wrappers are a new feature in **Plurimath** that allow users to define how specific symbols should be interpreted and displayed across various formats such as **UnicodeMath**, **LaTeX**, and **AsciiMath**. This feature is crucial for maintaining the integrity and intended meaning of mathematical expressions when they are converted between different formats.

Compatibility wrappers syntax for each language is as follows:

* **LaTeX** syntax: `\latex{P[<symbol>]}`
* **AsciiMath** syntax: `"P{<symbol>}"`
* **UnicodeMath** syntax: `"P{<symbol>}"`

NOTE: The output of **UnicodeMath**, **MathML**, and **OMML** doesn't have a wrapper since `\sum` will be converted to `âˆ‘` or `\&#x2211;` which doesn't need a wrapper.

== Benefits of Compatibility Wrappers

The introduction of compatibility wrappers offers following benefits:

- **Consistency Across Formats:** Ensures that symbols retain their meaning and appearance across different mathematical notation systems.
- **Enhanced Readability:** Improves the readability and clarity of mathematical expressions, especially in educational and research contexts where precise symbol representation is critical.

== How to Use Compatibility Wrappers

To utilize compatibility wrappers in **Plurimath**, Here is a simple example of how to use a symbol not supported in **AsciiMath** and **LaTeX** but supported in **UnicodeMath**:

[source,ruby]
----
formula = Plurimath::Math.parse("\\dashrightarrow", :unicode)
> Plurimath::Math::Formula.new([
  Plurimath::Math::Symbols::Dashrightarrow.new
])
----

The compatibility wrapper will convert the symbol to **AsciiMath** and **LaTeX** inside the **Plurimath only wrapper**.

[source,ruby]
----
formula.to_asciimath
> "\"P{dashrightarrow}\""
formula.to_latex
> "\\latex{P[dashrightarrow]}"
----

Compatibility wrappers are supported as input as well as output. Let's see an example below.

[source,ruby]
----
formula = Plurimath::Math.parse("\"P{updownharpoonleftleft}\"", :unicode)
> Plurimath::Math::Formula.new([
  Plurimath::Math::Symbols::Leftupdownharpoon.new
])
formula.to_latex
> "\\updownharpoonleftleft"
formula.to_asciimath
> "\"P{leftupdownharpoon}\""
----
