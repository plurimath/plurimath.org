== Introduction

Plurimath now offers math compatibility wrappers, allowing the complete
superset of all symbols across all supported math represented languages.


== Not all math languages support all math symbols

There are a multitude of math representation languages in use today, including
MathML, LaTeX, AsciiMath, and UnicodeMath. Each of these languages supports a
set of symbols and syntax for representing mathematical expressions.

However, not all these languages support the same set of symbols. For example:

* the LaTeX symbol `backepsilon` is not supported in AsciiMath
* the symbol `dashrightarrow` is supported in UnicodeMath but not supported in
LaTeX or AsciiMath.

This means that a mathematical symbol like `backepsilon` from LaTeX math means
that it cannot be represented or round-tripped to AsciiMath or any other math
language.

Previously, the lack of support for certain symbols in specific languages has
not been a significant concern since users can simply switch to another language
that supports that particular symbol. However, with developers increasingly
using Plurimath as a bridge between different math languages, this limitation
has become more apparent.

== Enter compatibility wrappers

Compatibility wrappers are a new feature in **Plurimath** that allow users to
define how specific symbols should be interpreted and displayed across various
formats such as **UnicodeMath**, **LaTeX**, and **AsciiMath**.

This feature is crucial for maintaining the integrity and intended meaning of
mathematical expressions when they are converted between different formats.

It is so named because Plurimath can wrap an unsupported symbol in a language
with a compatibility wrapper that is supported in that particular languages.

This allows the symbol to be represented in a way that is compatible with the
target language, ensuring that the symbol retains its meaning across different
mathematical notation systems.

In addition, compatibility wrappers enable the round-tripping of mathematical
expressions between different formats without losing any information or
introducing errors. This means that when the math representation language
can finally support a new symbol, the new symbol will be converted properly in
that language.

The introduction of compatibility wrappers offers following benefits:

* **Consistency across formats:** Ensures that symbols retain their meaning and
appearance across different mathematical notation systems.

* **Retained semantics:** Preserves the intended meaning of mathematical
expressions when they are converted between different formats.

* **Enhanced readability:** Improves the readability and clarity of mathematical
expressions, especially in educational and research contexts where precise
symbol representation is critical.


== Syntax of compatibility wrappers

The goal of a compatibility wrapper is introduce no side effects to the original
language that represents the symbol. This means that the compatibility wrapper
is easiest implemented as a text object that is not interpreted by the original
language.

The compatibility wrapper is only used when the symbol is not supported in the
original language.

The compatibility wrapper syntax for each language is defined as follows:

* **LaTeX** syntax: `\latex{P[<symbol>]}`
* **AsciiMath** syntax: `"P{<symbol>}"`
* **UnicodeMath** syntax: `"P{<symbol>}"`

The outputs of **UnicodeMath**, **MathML**, and **OMML** do not require wrapping
since the symbol designated (e.g. `\sum`) will be converted to the Unicode
equivalent (e.g. `âˆ‘`) or the XML entity form (e.g. `\&#x2211;`), that do not
need any wrapping.


== Using compatibility wrappers

Compatibility wrappers are automatically applied when a symbol is not supported
in a particular language. This means that users do not need to manually specify
which symbols should be wrapped in a compatibility wrapper.

The examples below illustrate how compatibility wrappers work.

.Converting `backepsilon` to AsciiMath from LaTeX using compatibility wrappers
[example]
====
The `backepsilon` is a symbol not supported in **AsciiMath** but recognized in
**LaTeX**.

The compatibility wrapper will convert the symbol to **AsciiMath** inside a
compatibility wrapper, but the LaTeX output is unchanged.

[source,ruby]
----
> formula = Plurimath::Math.parse("\\backepsilon", :latex)
# or
# Plurimath::Math::Formula.new([
#   Plurimath::Math::Symbols::Backepsilon.new
# ])
> formula.to_asciimath
# => "\"P{backepsilon}\""
> formula.to_latex
# => "\\backepsilon"
----
====


.Converting `dashrightarrow` to AsciiMath and LaTeX using compatibility wrappers
[example]
====
The `dashrightarrow` is a symbol not supported in both **AsciiMath** and
**LaTeX**, but supported in **UnicodeMath**.

[source,ruby]
----
formula = Plurimath::Math.parse("\\dashrightarrow", :unicode)
# or
# Plurimath::Math::Formula.new([
#   Plurimath::Math::Symbols::Dashrightarrow.new
# ])
----

The compatibility wrapper will convert the symbol to **AsciiMath** and **LaTeX**
inside the **Plurimath wrapper**, and allow round-trip of the symbol.

[source,ruby]
----
formula.to_asciimath
> "\"P{dashrightarrow}\""
formula.to_latex
> "\\latex{P[dashrightarrow]}"
----
====

Compatibility wrappers are also supported as input.

.Converting `updownharpoonleftleft` to LaTeX and AsciiMath using compatibility wrappers
[example]
====
The `updownharpoonleftleft` symbol is supported in **LaTeX** but not
**UnicodeMath** and **AsciiMath**.

[source,ruby]
----
formula = Plurimath::Math.parse("\"P{updownharpoonleftleft}\"", :unicode)
> Plurimath::Math::Formula.new([
    Plurimath::Math::Symbols::Leftupdownharpoon.new
  ])
formula.to_latex
> "\\updownharpoonleftleft"
formula.to_asciimath
> "\"P{leftupdownharpoon}\""
----
====

With compatibility wrappers, a formula containing a symbol that is not supported
in an intermediary language can still be converted and round-tripped back to the
original language.

.Round-tripping a formula containing unsupported symbols between AsciiMath and LaTeX
[example]
====
The `backepsilon` symbol is not supported in **AsciiMath** but recognized in
**LaTeX**.

[source,ruby]
----
formula = Plurimath::Math.parse('\([u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3, ... , u_n] \backepsilon [[0 \leq u_i \leq 1] \wedge \sum u_i = 1.0]\)', :latex)
asciimath = formula.to_asciimath
> "[u_(0), u_(1), u_(2), u_(3), \"...\", u_(n)] \"P{backepsilon}\" [[0 le u_(i) le 1] ^^ sum u_(i) = 1.0]"
formula_am = Plurimath::Math.parse(asciimath, :asciimath)
formula_am.to_latex
> "\\([u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3, ... , u_n] \\backepsilon [[0 \\leq u_i \\leq 1] \\wedge \\sum u_i = 1.0]\\)"
formula == formula_am
> true
----
====


== Conclusion

The introduction of compatibility wrappers in **Plurimath** enables the seamless
conversion between all math representation languages regardless of their
inherent limitations in handling certain math symbols.

This gives users the confidence that their mathematical expressions will be
accurately represented and interpreted across different formats, ensuring that
the intended meaning of the symbols is preserved.
