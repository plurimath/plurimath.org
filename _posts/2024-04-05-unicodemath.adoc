= UnicodeMath support in Plurimath

== Introduction

**Plurimath** has long been a versatile tool for handling various mathematical
notation systems, including **AsciiMath**, **MathML**, **LaTeX**, and **OMML**.

Plurimath now includes support for **UnicodeMath**, opening up new possibilities
for mathematical expression and representation.

== UnicodeMath

=== Expressing math in Unicode

UnicodeMath is an innovative approach to encoding mathematical expressions using
Unicode characters in a nearly plain-text format.

Invented by https://www.linkedin.com/in/murraysargent[Murray Sargent III],
long-time representative at the Unicode Consortium, retired physicist, and
distinguished software engineer of Microsoft, UnicodeMath bridges the gap
between human-readable mathematical notation and computer-encoded expressions.

UnicodeMath's usefulness stems from the extensive availability of mathematical
symbols in https://unicode.org[Unicode] (ISO/IEC 10646). Unicode provides a vast
array of mathematical symbols, making it possible to represent complex
mathematical expressions using direct character input rather than relying on
specialized markup commands.

Traditional mathematical typesetting systems often require users to memorize
specific commands to represent mathematical symbols. For example, in LaTeX, one
might need to use `\sum` for a summation symbol or `\int` for an integral. This
approach burdens users with the task of memorizing these commands and
understanding their visual characteristics.

In contrast, UnicodeMath allows users to directly input the actual mathematical
symbols as they appear visually.

.Direct entry as Unicode instead of commands
|===
| UnicodeMath entry | LaTeX command

| Direct input of `∑` (U+2211 N-ARY SUMMATION) | `\sum`
| Direct input of `∫` (U+222B INTEGRAL) | `\int`
| Direct input of `∞` (U+221E INFINITY) | `\infty`

|===

This direct symbol usage significantly reduces the cognitive load on users,
especially those who are not professional mathematicians or frequent users of
mathematical typesetting systems. It allows for a more intuitive and visual
approach to inputting mathematical expressions, closely mimicking how one might
write mathematics by hand.

Similar to other math expression languages, UnicodeMath also takes advantage of
the spatial relationships between characters to infer mathematical meaning.

For example:

* Superscripts can be denoted by using the `^` character: `x^2` represents x².
* Subscripts can be indicated with `_`: `a_1` represents a₁.
* Fractions can be written using `/`: `a/b` is interpreted as a fraction.

This approach combines the visual intuitiveness of handwritten mathematics with
the precision and standardization offered by Unicode, creating a powerful and
user-friendly system for mathematical notation in digital environments.


==== Name syntax string notation

While UnicodeMath primarily leverages the extensive set of mathematical symbols
available in Unicode, there are instances where a desired symbol or operator may
not have a direct Unicode representation.

To address this, UnicodeMath incorporates a "name syntax string notation" as an
alternative input method.

The name syntax string notation allows users to input mathematical symbols or
operators using descriptive names enclosed in backslashes.

There are actually two major reasons why the name syntax notation is necessary:

. Allows commonly-used symbols beyond those directly available in Unicode;
. Let's face it: Unicode entry, especially for symbols on the Unicode math
  plane, is not always easiest on the keyboard. A named symbol provides an
  intuitive way to input complex or less common symbols.

Here are some examples of name syntax string notation in UnicodeMath:

* `\lceil` represents the left ceiling bracket (⌈)
* `\rceil` represents the right ceiling bracket (⌉)
* `\lfloor` represents the left floor bracket (⌊)
* `\rfloor` represents the right floor bracket (⌋)
* `\naryand` represents the n-ary logical AND (⋀)
* `\naryor` represents the n-ary logical OR (⋁)

In practice, this notation seamlessly integrates with direct Unicode input.

This UnicodeMath expression:

----
\lceil x \rceil + \lfloor y \rfloor = z
----

Is interpreted and displayed as: ⌈x⌉ + ⌊y⌋ = z
====

The name syntax string notation also extends to more complex mathematical structures.

For instance:

* `\matrix{a,b;c,d}` can be used to represent a 2x2 matrix
* `\eqarray{a=b;c=d}` can create a system of equations

This notation system strikes a balance between the direct visual input of
Unicode symbols and the expressive power of named commands, providing users with
a flexible and comprehensive tool for mathematical expression.

It's worth noting that while Plurimath supports both Unicode string input and
name syntax string input for UnicodeMath, the output is always in Unicode
representation. This ensures consistency and leverages the full visual
capabilities of UnicodeMath across different platforms and applications.

=== Origins of UnicodeMath: Murray Sargent

Murray Sargent's journey in developing UnicodeMath is rooted in his extensive
experience with mathematical typesetting and software development. As a key
figure in developing math support for Microsoft Office applications, Sargent
recognized the need for a more intuitive, readable, and universally compatible
mathematical notation system.

His work on UnicodeMath has revolutionized how users can input mathematical
expressions directly into programs like Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote.
This innovation has significantly enhanced the user experience for students,
educators, and professionals working with mathematical content in digital
environments.


=== Implementations

The two prominent implementations of UnicodeMath are:

* UnicodeMathML
* Microsoft Equation Editor

https://github.com/doersino/UnicodeMathML[UnicodeMathML (original)] was
originally created by https://github.com/doersino[Noah Doersing] in 2019
as a JavaScript-based approach to allow easy entry of Unicode math symbols
for UnicodeMath.

https://github.com/MurrayIII/UnicodeMathML[UnicodeMathML (new)] is developed by
Murray Sargent on top of Doersing's UnicodeMathML, in order to keep the
implementation updated with the latest specification.

The most popular implementation is likely the Microsoft Equation Editor, which
is a component of Microsoft Office applications such as Word, PowerPoint, and
OneNote offered on local installations and on Office 365.

This integration, spearheaded by Murray Sargent himself, allows users to input
mathematical expressions using UnicodeMath directly into their documents.

The Microsoft Equation Editor interprets UnicodeMath in real-time, converting it
into properly formatted mathematical expressions. This feature significantly
enhances the user experience for anyone working with mathematical content in
Microsoft Office, from students and educators to researchers and professionals.

For example, typing `a^2 + b^2 = c^2` in the Equation Editor would automatically
format it as a properly typeset mathematical equation, with superscripts and
proper spacing.


=== Advantages of UnicodeMath

UnicodeMath offers compelling advantages over traditional mathematical notation
systems:

Enhanced readability:: UnicodeMath is encoded in a format that closely resembles
displayed mathematics, making it intuitive to read and understand.

Reduced learning curve:: For users new to mathematical typesetting, UnicodeMath
presents a gentler learning curve compared to systems like LaTeX.

Preserved semantics:: An equation encoded in UnicodeMath retains all semantics
when it is copied and pasted across applications and platforms.

Here are some examples that illustrate these advantages.

In the first example, UnicodeMath and AsciiMath offer a more straightforward
representation of simple fractions. While LaTeX provides more control over
formatting, it requires learning specific commands, which can be a barrier for
beginners.

.Fractions represented in different math expression languages
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Notation system |Expression |Explanation

|UnicodeMath
|`a/b`
|Simple and intuitive, resembling handwritten fractions.

|LaTeX
|`\frac{a}{b}`
|Requires specific command and braces.

|AsciiMath
|`a/b`
|Similar to UnicodeMath.

|===

UnicodeMath shines in the following example by using the actual summation symbol
(∑), making the expression more visually appealing and closer to traditional
mathematical notation. LaTeX offers precise control but at the cost of
readability in its raw form, while AsciiMath provides a middle ground.

.Summation represented in different math expression languages
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Notation system |Expression |Explanation

|UnicodeMath
|`∑_(i=1)^n i^2`
|Uses actual Unicode symbols, visually resembling handwritten math.

|LaTeX
|`\sum_{i=1}^n i^2`
|Requires knowledge of specific commands and syntax.

|AsciiMath
|`sum_(i=1)^n i^2`
|Uses plain text approximations of mathematical symbols.
|===

In this complex expression involving integration, UnicodeMath's use of actual
symbols (∞, √) makes it more compact and visually similar to handwritten
mathematics. LaTeX provides the most control for professional typesetting but is
less intuitive to read in its raw form. AsciiMath offers a good balance but
lacks the visual appeal of actual mathematical symbols.

.Complex expressions represented in different math expression languages
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Notation system |Expression |Explanation

|UnicodeMath
|`∫_0^∞ e^(-x^2) dx = √(π)/2`
|Compact and readable, using actual symbols for infinity and square root.

|LaTeX
|`\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}/2`
|Precise but requires more specialized knowledge to interpret.

|AsciiMath
|`int_0^oo e^(-x^2) dx = sqrt(pi)/2`
|Readable but uses text approximations for special symbols.

== Leveraging UnicodeMath with Plurimath

=== General

With an understanding of the advantages of UnicodeMath, we explore how to
utilize it in Plurimath.

=== Parsing

This code snippet demonstrates how to parse a UnicodeMath string into a
Plurimath formula object.

[source,ruby]
----
string = '∑_(i=1)^n i^3'
formula = Plurimath::Math.parse(string, :unicode) <1>
----
<1> The `:unicode` parameter specifies that the input is in UnicodeMath format.


=== Generation and round-tripping

Here, we convert the formula object back to a UnicodeMath string. In other
words, it normalizes an input UnicodeMath expression into a "cleaned"
UnicodeMath expression.

[source,ruby]
----
formula.to_unicodemath # => '∑_(i = 1)^(n) i^(3)'
----

Notice how the Plurimath normalization process maintains the UnicodeMath format
while potentially adjusting spacing for clarity.

While Plurimath supports both Unicode string input and name syntax string input
for UnicodeMath, the output will **always** be in Unicode representation to
maintain consistency and leverage the full visual capabilities of UnicodeMath.


=== Visualizing the parse tree

This parse tree visualization helps understand how Plurimath interprets the
UnicodeMath expression, breaking it down into its constituent parts.

[source,ruby]
----
formula.to_display(:unicode) <1>
# |_ Math zone
#   |_ '∑_(i = 1)^(n) i^(3)'
#      |_ '∑' summation
#         |_ 'i = 1' lower limit
#         |_ 'n' upper limit
#         |_ 'i^(3)' expression
----
<1> The `to_display(:unicode)` method allows a `Plurimath::Math::Formula` object
to be shown as a parse tree for UnicodeMath.


=== Converting UnicodeMath to MathML

This conversion to MathML showcases Plurimath's ability to transform UnicodeMath
into a more structured, XML-based format suitable for web applications and other
digital platforms.

[source,ruby]
----
formula.to_mathml
# => "<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
#       <mstyle displaystyle='true'>
#         <munderover>
#           <mo>∑</mo>
#           <mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow>
#           <mi>n</mi>
#         </munderover>
#         <msup><mi>i</mi><mn>3</mn></msup>
#       </mstyle>
#     </math>"
----

=== Converting UnicodeMath to AsciiMath

This example demonstrates the conversion from UnicodeMath to AsciiMath,
illustrating how Plurimath can bridge different mathematical notation systems.

[source,ruby]
----
formula.to_asciimath
# => "sum_(i=1)^n i^3"
----

== Conclusion

The addition of UnicodeMath support to Plurimath represents a significant step
forward in the realm of digital mathematical notation, and is a testament to
Plurimath's commitment to UnicodeMath as a math expression language.

NOTE: Plurimath is the third major implementation of UnicodeMath and the second
open-source implementation.

Support of UnicodeMath also demonstrates Plurimath's dedication to handle major
flavors of formal math representation languages for the user's unhindered
expressiveness:

* Users can write math in the language of choice, and rely on Plurimath to
automatically convert between representation languages with semantics preserved,
purely according to their technical platform needs.

* The mathematics expression models in Plurimath are demonstrably compliant
to all supported math languages, including UnicodeMath and MathML.

Until then!
